This site showcases my professional portfolio and previous data analytics work. My previous work can be viewed under the “Portfolio” tab, additionally, you can also view my resume and previous experience. My primary areas of interest are environmental and natural resource economics and applied econometrics. I am currently seeking an entry-level role in environmental economics, data analytics, or sustainability. I have a strong passion for environmental sustainability and wish to use my economic skillset to contribute to a greener world. 

About Me
======
I was born and raised in Denver, CO, and then came to Tucson, AZ for college where I am currently residing. In my free time, I like to go hiking, watch/play sports, and explore new places. I am also an avid photographer and enjoy shooting nature and urban scenery. I took an AP Environmental Science class in high school and found a true passion for environmental sustainability which drives me to this day. 

Academic Background 
======
I started college with environmental science as my major but decided to switch after my first year, wanting something with less focus on the lab sciences and more focus on policy and decision-making. I became very intrigued by the idea of environmental economics, and once I started taking the classes I was hooked. I thoroughly enjoy looking at environmental issues through an economic lens and using statistical and econometric techniques to solve problems. I ended up doing an accelerated master’s program, that allows me to graduate with a master’s degree in 5 years instead of 6, which I will be completing in May 2024. My coursework focuses on statistics, econometrics, environmental economics, and policy analysis.

Professional Experience 
======
Thus far, my relevant experience has been largely limited to an academic setting except for a semester-long consulting project with American Express. Some of the key projects I have worked on are:
-	Research project on cost-benefit analyses of solar energy projects
-	Research project on water sustainability incentive program in Nevada 
-	Master’s thesis on Farm Adoption of Computer Technology
-	Developed a theoretical model to measure baseball player value 
Through these projects, I gained experience in SAS, R, Stata, Excel, Technical Writing, and GitHub.


Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
