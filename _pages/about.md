This site showcases my professional portfolio and previous data analytics work. My previous work can be viewed under the “Portfolio” tab, additionally, you can also view my resume and previous experience. My primary areas of interest are environmental and natural resource economics and applied econometrics. I am currently seeking an entry-level role in environmental economics, data analytics, or sustainability. I have a strong passion for environmental sustainability and wish to use my economic skillset to contribute to a greener world. 

About Me
======
I was born and raised in Denver, CO, and then came to Tucson, AZ for college where I am currently residing. In my free time, I like to go hiking, watch/play sports, and explore new places. I am also an avid photographer and enjoy shooting nature and urban scenery. I took an AP Environmental Science class in high school and found a true passion for environmental sustainability which drives me to this day. 

Academic Background 
======
I started college with environmental science as my major but decided to switch after my first year, wanting something with less focus on the lab sciences and more focus on policy and decision-making. I became very intrigued by the idea of environmental economics, and once I started taking the classes I was hooked. I thoroughly enjoy looking at environmental issues through an economic lens and using statistical and econometric techniques to solve problems. I ended up doing an accelerated master’s program, that allows me to graduate with a master’s degree in 5 years instead of 6, which I will be completing in May 2024.

Projects 
======
Thus far, my relevant experience has been largely limited to an academic setting except for a semester-long consulting project with American Express. Some of the key projects I have worked on are:
-	Research project on cost-benefit analyses of solar energy projects
-	Research project on water sustainability incentive program in Nevada 
-	Master’s thesis on Farm Adoption of Computer Technology
-	Developed a theoretical model to measure baseball player value
-	Worked as a research assistant studying economic impact of University of Arizona Athletics on the city of Tucson
-	Data analytics consulting project with American Express
